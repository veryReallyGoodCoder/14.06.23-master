        <p>My name is Yairon Leibrandt. I am an aspiring game designer and am pursing this as a second year student of Game Design at SAE Institute, Johannesburg.</p>
        <p>Although Game Design is my primary focus, I also have other pursuits, such as:
            <p>Drumming</p>
            <p>Modelling and Acting</p>
            <p>Digital and Graphic Design</p>
        </p>

        <p>I am also the CEO of Game Brand Co. At GBC, we aim see the lives of African peoples benefitted through the gamification of education, addressing topics such as road safety, proper hygeine practices and the maintenance of household items and such. The extent of our reach is contained within our origins, in South Africa, however plans are in work to reach out to the rest of our majestic continent.</p>
        <p>Interested in our development?</p>
